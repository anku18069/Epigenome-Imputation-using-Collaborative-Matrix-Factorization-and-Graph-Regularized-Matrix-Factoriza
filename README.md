# Epigenome-Imputation-using-Collaborative-Matrix-Factorization-and-Graph-Regularized-Matrix-Factoriza
Collaborative Filtering Project
In this project our aim is to computationally predict the
strength of interaction  between the cell and chromatin site using Collaborative Matrix Factorization and Graph Regularized Matrix Factorization. Specifically, we first give an insight into the two methods -Collaborative Matrix Factorization and Graph Regularized Matrix Factorization  , then  we analyze how well the given methods perform on the epigenome dataset
